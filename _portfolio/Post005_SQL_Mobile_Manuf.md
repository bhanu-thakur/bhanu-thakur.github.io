## Mobile Manufacturer EDA Assignment by AnalytixLabs Noida

> #### Q7. List if there is any model that was in the top 5 in terms of quantity, simultaneously in 2008, 2009 and 2010


> A computer program can easily produce gibberish - especially if it has been provided with garbage beforehand. This program does something a little different. It takes a block of text as input and works out the proportion of characters within the text according to a chosen order. For example, an order of 2 means the program looks at pairs of letters, an order of 3 means triplets of letters and so on. The software can regurgitate random text that is controlled by the proportion of characters. The results can be quite surprising.
